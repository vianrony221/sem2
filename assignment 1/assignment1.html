        <h3>Lyrics</h3>
        <p>Pour up <span>(drank)</span>, head shot <span>(drank)</span><br>
            Sit down <span>(drank)</span>, stand up <span>(drank)</span><br>
            Pass out <span>(drank)</span>, wake up <span>(drank)</span><br>
            Faded <span>(drank)</span>, faded <span>(drank)</span></p>
        <p>Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles<br>
            Granddaddy had the golden flask<br>
            Backstroke every day in Chicago<br>
            Some people like the way it feels<br>
            Some people wanna kill their sorrows<br>
            Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem<br>
            I was in the dark room, loud tunes, lookin' to make a vow soon<br>
            That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup, I see the crowd mood<br>
            Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat<br>
            Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me</p>
        <p>Nigga why you babysittin' only two or three shots?<br>
            I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch<br>
            First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it<br>
            Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it<br>
            I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock<br>
            All the girls wanna play Baywatch<br>
            I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it<br>
            Po-pool full of liquor I'ma dive in it</p>
        <p>Pour up <span>(drank)</span>, head shot <span>(drank)</span><br>
            Sit down <span>(drank)</span>, stand up <span>(drank)</span><br>
            Pass out <span>(drank)</span>, wake up <span>(drank)</span><br>
            Faded <span>(drank)</span>, faded <span>(drank)</span></p>
        <p>Okay, now open your mind up and listen to me, Kendrick<br>
            I'm your conscience, if you do not hear me<br>
            Then you will be history, Kendrick<br>
            I know that you're nauseous right now<br>
            And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick<br>
            If I take another one down I'ma drown in some poison abusin' my limit<br>
            I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes<br>
            I see the feelin', the freedom is granted<br>
            As soon as the damage of vodka arrive<br>
            This how you capitalize, this is parental advice<br>
            Then apparently, I'm over-influenced by what you are doin'<br>
            I thought I was doin' the most then someone said to me</p>
        <p>Nigga why you babysittin' only two or three shots?<br>
            I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch<br>
            First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it<br>
            Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it<br>
            I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock<br>
            All the girls wanna play Baywatch<br>
            I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it<br>
            Po-pool full of liquor I'ma dive in it</p>
        <p>Pour up <span>(drank)</span>, head shot <span>(drank)</span><br>
            Sit down <span>(drank)</span>, stand up <span>(drank)</span><br>
            Pass out <span>(drank)</span>, wake up <span>(drank)</span><br>
            Faded <span>(drank)</span>, faded <span>(drank)</span></p>
        <p>I ride, you ride, bang<br>
            One chopper, 100 shots, bang<br>
            Hop out, do you bang?<br>
            Two chopper, 200 shots, bang<br>
            I ride, you ride, bang<br>
            One chopper, 100 shots, bang<br>
            Hop out, do you bang?<br>
            Two chopper, 200 shots, bang</p>
        <p>Nigga why you babysittin' only two or three shots?<br>
            I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch<br>
            First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it<br>
            Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it<br>
            I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock<br>
            All the girls wanna play Baywatch<br>
            I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it<br>
            Po-pool full of liquor I'ma dive in it</p>
        <p>Pour up <span>(drank)</span>, head shot <span>(drank)</span><br>
            Sit down <span>(drank)</span>, stand up <span>(drank)</span><br>
            Pass out <span>(drank)</span>, wake up <span>(drank)</span><br>
            Faded <span>(drank)</span>, faded <span>(drank)</span></p>
        <p>Sherane, Sherane<br>
            (Pool full of Kendrick's lies in it)<br>
            (W-watch 'em all flock)<br>
            Aw man, where is she takin' me?<br>
            Where is she takin' me? (Pool full of liquor I'ma die in it)<br>
            All I, all I, all I, all I have in life is my new appetite for failure<br>
            And I got Hunger pain that grow insane, tell me do that sound familiar?<br>
            If it do then you're like me, making excuse that your relief<br>
            Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf<br>
            As the window open I release everything that corrode inside of me<br>
            I see you joking, why you laugh? Don't you feel bad?<br>
            I probably sleep and never ever wake up<br>
            Never ever wake up, never ever wake up<br>
            In God I trust<br>
            But just when I thought I had enough<br>
            They stomped the homie out over a bitch?<br>
            K-Dot, you good, blood?<br>
            Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off<br>
            That nigga's straight, man, that nigga ain't trippin'<br>
            We gon' do the same ol' shit<br>
            I'ma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways<br>
            Fall right in -'s lap<br>
            And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that<br>
            And I hope that bitch that set him up out there<br>
            We gon' pop that bitch too<br>
            Wait hold up, ayy, I see someone<br>
            Aha, got them niggas, K-Dot, you good?<br>
            L-, you good?<br>
            Yeah, blood, I'm good, Dave, you good?<br>
            Dave? Dave, say somethin', Dave?<br>
            These bitch ass  niggas killed my brother</p>
